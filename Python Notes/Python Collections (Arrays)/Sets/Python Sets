
##Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
##A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeabnle*, and unindexed but you can add new items.

Set0 = {'berry', True, False, 'Melon'}       #Sets are written with curly brackets.
print(Set0)



#Sets are unordered, meaning they have no defined order.
#Because of this, sets can appear in a different order every time you use them.
#Hence why they cannot be referred to by index or key.

#Sets cannot have duplicates. Dupes are not deleted, they are ignored.
Set1 = {'Berry', 'melon', 'Berry'}
print(Set1)

#True and the number "1" are considered the same value in sets, therefore treated as duplicates.
#Same concept aplies with the number "0" and False
Set2 = {True, 0, False, 1}
print(Set2)

#You can use the len() function to find the length of a set.
Set3 = {True}
print(len(Set3))

#Sets can hold any data type and a single set can contain multiple data types aswell.
Set4 = {False, 24, 'String'}
print(Set4)

#Use the type() function to find type of data type of set.
print(type(Set4))

#Use can also use set() constructor to creates sets.
Set5 = set(('blue', 'gold', 32))
print(Set5)
