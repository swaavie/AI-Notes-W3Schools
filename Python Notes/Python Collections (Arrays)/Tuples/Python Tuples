Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single Variable
Tuple is on of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data,
the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A tuple is a colleciton which is ordered, allows duplicate values, and is unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets

Tuple = ("Fruit", "Pasta", "Chicken")
print(Tuple)

#Tuples allow duplicate values.
Tuple2 = ("Fruit", "Fruit", "Chicken", "Fruit")
print(Tuple2)

#Use the len() function to find out how many items the tuple has.
print(len(Tuple))

#When creating a tuple with one value, you must remember the comma.
Tuple4 = ("Tomato",)

#NOT a tuple
Tuple5 = ("apple")
print(type(Tuple5))

#Tuples can hold any data type.
Tuple6 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")  #Strings
Tuple7 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)                #Integers
Tuple8 = (True, False, False)           #Booleans

#A Tuple can also hold multiple data types.
Tuple9 = ("Cranberry", 2, False)
print(Tuple9)

#The data type of a Tuple is <class 'tuple'>
print(type(Tuple9))

#You can also use Tupple constructor to create a Tuple.
Tuple10 = tuple(("Cranberry", 2, False, True))
print(Tuple10)
