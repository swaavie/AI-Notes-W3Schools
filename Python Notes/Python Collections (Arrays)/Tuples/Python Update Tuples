'''
Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created. (Immutable)
However, you can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

#To delete entries from a tuple, you can either do the list trick, or delete the tuple entirely using the del keyword.
