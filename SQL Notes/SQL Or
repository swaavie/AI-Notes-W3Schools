/*
The WHERE clause can contain one or more OR operators.
The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain:
*/
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain';

/*
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.

The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where either City is "Berlin", CustomerName starts with the letter "G" or Country is "Norway":
*/
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin' OR CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR Country = 'Norway';

/*
You can combine the AND and OR operators.
The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that starts with a "G" or an "R".
Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result.
*/

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
